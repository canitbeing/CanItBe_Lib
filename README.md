## CanitBe Autolisp Library
- This file is a list of functions available in AutoLISP.
- The function names are created to be similar to JavaScript methods.

## Installation
- All the functions I use are included in (canitbe).
- By loading the .fas file and adding (canitbe) at the top of the function, you can use the functions I created.

If you compile the app you created, include the corresponding .fas file in the compilation.

If you use it without compiling, you must set up the system to always load this .fas file.
